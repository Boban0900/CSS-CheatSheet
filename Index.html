                    What is a Selector?
                </h2>
                <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a
                    pattern
                    of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML
                    elements should be selected to have the CSS property values
                    inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements
                    which
                    are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject
                    of
                    the selector.</p>

                    In other articles you may have met some different selectors,
                    and
                    learned that there are selectors that target the document in
                    different ways â€” for example by selecting an element such as
                    <span>h1</span>,
                    or a class such as <span>.special</span>.
